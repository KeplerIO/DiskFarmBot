*   These are personal notes and ideas to serve as a roadmap/tasklist as the application is developed  *
*   For a proper detailed explanation of the application's design, read the Architecture document      *

==== Reason for project & End-Goal ====
Some Discord servers have bots that implement a user XP/level-up system.
The bot awards users of the Discord server XP which will level them up. Based on the level of a user, Discord Server Roles are assigned to them.
XP is granted differently depending on how the server owner's have configured the bot that implements the XP system.

For example: A bot awards 1 XP to a user every minute, so long as they have sent 1 message within that minute.
             If they did not send a message during that minute, no XP is awarded.
             If more than 1 message is sent within a certain minute, still only 1 XP is awarded.

With the above knowledge, a program can be written to automatically enter chat messages in a Discord server at user-defined intervals.
This makes it possible for users to tune the application to farm on Discord Servers where the XP System bot is configured differently.
The program can be cross-platform and run on any PC operating system that Discord runs on.




!!!! All thought blocks marked as Completed are implemented and thoroughly detailed in the Architecture document

*   DiskFarmBot takes screenshots of the screen belonging to the machine it is running on.
*   It will take screenshots in somewhat quick succession so that it captures as much of the Discord chat as possible.
*   This will inevitably create multiple image files at the same time, that must all be analyzed (A queue). These images
*   will all live within the local application data special folder. All operating systems have equivalent "Special Folders", so, 
*   one task will be to ensure that our application data storage structure gets generated properly and in the correct location on multiple operating systems.
*
*   The following article outlines the concept of Special Folders in Windows but the idea can be translated to OSX and Linux OSes
*   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_folder

It is currently assumed that discord will be running fullscreen on the machine that is running DiskFarmBot. Maybe
dynamic screen regions will be thought about in the future.
